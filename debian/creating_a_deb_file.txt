To manually create a set if Debian .deb files run debuild in the
folder above this. Before running debuild you need to update the
changelog file in the debian folder to mention the nature of the
change that is about to be incorporated as well as specifying
the ESP-r version number (matching that of the Version file
in the ESP-r source distribution. 

There is also a script in this folder named create_deb.bash 
which will automate the process. For example of the current
source distribution is located in a folder named espr_13.1.2_Src.

Lets assume that the change log file has been updated. In the
debian folder you should copy create_deb.bash to the same level 
in your folder structure as espr_13.1.2_Src and run it via:
 ./create_deb.bash 13.1.2 espr_13.1.2_Src
where the first parameter is the version number and the
second parameter is the name of the source distribution
folder. A folder named to_build_13.1.2 will be created
in which the debian build process will be run. If sucessful
there will the three .deb files created - e.g. espr_13.1.2_amd64.deb 
espr-database_13.1.2_amd64.deb and espr-exemplars_13.1.2_amd64.deb

Here are some of the steps carried out in the create_deb.bash
script (in case you want to do things manually):

Find the revision number from svn if it is 13.1.1 then....
mkdir espr_13.1.1
rsync --exclude .svn --exclude .git -av ESP-r_Src_V13.1.1/ espr_13.1.1/
tar cf espr_13.1.1.tar espr_13.1.1 
gzip -9 espr_13.1.1.tar
mkdir to_build_13.1.1
cp espr_13.1.1.tar.gz to_build_13.1.1
cd to_build_13.1.1
tar xfz espr_13.1.1.tar.gz
ln -s espr_13.1.1.tar.gz espr_13.1.1.orig.tar.gz
cd espr_13.1.1

if not already done adapt the debian folder
 nedit debian/changelog
 nedit debian/control
 cd ../
then run debuild
when it finishes there should be 3 deb files in the folder above.
