This model approximates a retail box shed supermarket in the
UK with 2008 standard constructions.  There is diversity in
the internal gains. The public spaces are represented as a
foyer (with air mixing to the outside), main shop (with
internal mass of shelfs included), refrigerated section within
which is an abstract low temperature chilled cabinet and a
standard chilled cabinet (air is mixed with the cabinets to
approximate people accessing the cabinets).

There is a cafe on the right of the foyer and a newstand
and office on the left. The upper level includes an
office and a staff room with a passage connecting them.

The service areas at the back of the building include a
double height shipping and receiving area and storage
space for goods in transet and a small cold storage room.

Because of the large number of people that might be in the
building make-up air (6l/s/p) is passed through a tempered mixing
box (16C). The make-up air rate is reduced overnight. 

There are two models - a standard model and a variant which
includes a UK NCM description so that complience assessments
can be carried out.

The model is work-in-progress.
