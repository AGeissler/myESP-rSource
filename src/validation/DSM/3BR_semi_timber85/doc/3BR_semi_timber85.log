_____________________________
Notes: 
 
This house was taken from plans and represents timber-kit
construction which is in advance of late 1990s building 
standards in the far north of Scotland. 

For flexibility, each room of the dwelling has been
represented as well as spaces which are likely to be
at variant temperatures (under stairs, crawl space
and roof void).

The building construction is assumed to be tighter
than normal in terms of infiltration.

NOTE: this model does not yet have zone operations
defined so it is not yet possible to run simulaitons.
