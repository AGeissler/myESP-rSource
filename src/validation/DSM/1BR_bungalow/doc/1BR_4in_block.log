Notes: 

This is one half of a four unit dwelling (a lower one BR
flat and an upper one BR flat).  Its composition is representative
of timber-kit energy efficient public housing in the late
1990s in the North of Scotland.

Each room is explicitly represented as is the roof space 
and the crawl space. This allows transient occupancy patterns
to be studied as well as the impact on different infiltration
regimes.

This is an initial version of the model with the zone geometry
and composition specified. Room occupancy and environmental
controls have not yet been defined.
