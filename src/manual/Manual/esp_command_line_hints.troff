Introduction
.LP
Graphic environments are great until you want to do something that
isn't included. If you are using ESP-r within a Cygwin environment
on a Windows or an Apple computer (or even a Linux computer)
it is occassionally useful to put on a geek hat and do some
magic on the command line.
.LP
Another reason for going geek is to sort out problems in your
models of the 'it was working a few minutes ago' variety or
the 'Fred sent me a model and I can't get it working' variety.
.LP
And sometimes a bit of geek magic allows you automate 
tasks - e.g. create scripts that run a dozen assessments and 
extract specific performane data.
.LP
And sometimes a remote IT support or simulation expert 
will be using a lot of jargon and asking you to type in
commands for them.  What the expert thinks is a simple statement
like "in the command window go to the folder with the model 
configuration file" is loaded with implied knowledge that 
you might not have. And thus a 15 second task takes a lot 
longer or causes a lot of frustration. Wouldn't it be great 
to understand a bit of that jargon and more easily follow 
their instructions?
.LP
And sometimes you will want to archive models
or find the difference in today's model and one from a
week ago. Folk with an IT background know this stuff but
if it becomes your job to manage projects this primer
includes some of those IT skills.
.LP
And lastly, under the user interface is an industrial strength
engine for virtual physics which can be coerced far beyond its 
normal bounds via the command line.
.SH
A command line primer
.LP
The command line facilties within Cygwin, OSX and Linux are
similar so skills tend to be transferable. A subset of
commands are equivalent to graphical interactions e.g. navigation 
within the folders of the computer, managing files, 
searching for text, archiving work, transferring models to
colleagues and the like.  This primer should cover most
of what normal users of ESP-r need to know. Those who maintain
the system and work with the source code will of course, need 
additional skills and should look into the ESP-r Developers
Guide (see the ESRU web pages) as well as books on Unix
and Linux.
.LP
Lets start with some high level concepts:
.IP "\(bu " 2
The commands that will be described below are interpreted via a
command interpretors (also known as a command shell). One
interpretor is known as the bash shell and another
is 'csh'. Most commands are interpreted the same way
in both command shells although some of the optional parameters
are slightly different.  
.IP "\(bu " 2
The command shell runs in either a command or graphic window.
A command window only works with text based tasks and a
graphic window can work with either text or graphic
applications.  For example:
.IP "   Cygwin" 4
The inital command window (typiclly white text on a black 
background with a fixed width) that starts up supports text commands and
can only be used to invoke ESP-r in a pure-text mode (for example
to run automated tasks). If you try to invoke ESP-r in graphic
mode from the initial command window nothing will happen or you
will get a warning about cannot open display. To work with the 
graphic version of ESP-r you need to startup a graphic window
via a command like:
.br
\fBstartxwin.sh\fR
.br
which will start a graphic window (black text on a white background
and with an X in the top border). You can resize the graphic
window if you want. If you want you can have multiple graphic
windows open at the same time. When you are finished close the graphic
window (via the command exit). Then you can type exit in the
original command window.
.IP "   OSX 10.5 and 10.6" 4
OSX includes a default 'terminal' which can take either text or
graphic commands (??).  There is also an X11 graphic window
(typically called an xterm) which is available as part of the X11
environment. As X11 is required for ESP-r use you have a choice.
X11 supports networked displays (where what you see in the
xterm could be an application running on a different computer).
This feature can be useful for accessing a compute server
as well as for IT support staff to access your computer.
.IP "   Linux" 4
On linux machines the overall graphic environment is dictated
by whether the computer is using KDE or Gnome.  Each come with
a different set of tools and several choices for graphic windows.
As with Cygwin and OSX you can have multiple graphic windows running
at the same time as well as networked displays.
.IP "\(bu " 2
You will have a login account and an area to work in which 
is protected from the chaos of other users. On Linux and
OSX it is possible to have multiple users working simultaneously
on the computer.  Sometimes it is useful to have an alternative 
user account for testing so that your normal working area is 
not altered.  Cygwin is dependent on Windows for the
user account so one must switch users but may not have two
users simultaneously. Login accound names might cause 
problems if it includes spaces or unprintable characters.
.IP "\(bu " 2
The permissions associated with files and folders can help
as well as hinder your work. Files you get from another person 
might not have the correct permissions for use in your account 
and you might find that changes you make in your model
might not be written to the model files. Commands to identify
and correct permissions is thus a common task.
.IP "   Cygwin" 4
The underlying Windows platform supports a different concept
of permissions for folders and files than OSX and Linux. For
example is easier to overwrite and corrupt critical databases
in Cygwin than it is in OSX or Linux.  To change permissions
set by another user one must switch to that user.
.IP "   OSX and Linux" 4
Since OSX and Linux are derived from Unix, both able to
set permissions on files and folders at find resolution.
Both support the concept of 'the current user', the
group that the user is in, and 'others'. It is possible 
ensure that only specific staff are able to update databases. 
It is possible to set read and write permissions separately
for the user, group and others. To change perissions
set by another user one would typically use a sudo prefix
to a command to temporarily become that user.
.IP "\(bu " 2
Cygwin and OSX and Linux use a hierarchical directory structure
beginning at "/" (equivalent to c:\ on a PC) which is the 
so called 'root' directory and everything else hangs off of that.
There is no A:B:C:D:E: drive. 
.IP "   Cygwin" 4
The Cygwin command window you will be able to navigate to folders 
in the A:B:C:... drives.  The path within Cygwin 
becomes /cygdrive/c or /cygdrive/d.  Note the use of /
rather than \\ when working within the Cygwin environment.
.IP "\(bu " 2
Paths to files which are included in an ESP-r model
are sensitive to the operating system they were created
with.  A model created with a 'native windows' version
of ESP-r will include paths in the form C:\\Esru\\databases while
ESP-r models created on Linux will follow the
path pattern /home/fred/databases and on OSX will follow
the pattern /Users/fred/databases.
.br
Path conventions thus complicate the task of moving a model between
computers with different operating systems - a C:\\Esru path
will tend to confuse ESP-r running on a different type of
computer. There are scripts which can convert models which you need to 
know about.
.IP "\(bu " 2
Your HOME folder on Linux might be in /home/jackson 
(if you name is jackson).  On OSX user folders would typically 
follow the pattern of /Users/jackson.  Within Cygwin the
users home tends to be C:\\Documents and Settings\\user_name 
although when setting up Cyginw there will be a /home/user_name.
.IP "\(bu " 2
Case sensitivity differs in OSX and Linux and Cygwin:
.IP "   Cygwin" 4
Cyginw is not case sensitive for the names of files and 
folders (for a folder namde /home/fred/Src the commands:
.br
cd /home/fred/src and cd /home/fred/Src are equivalent.
.IP "   OSX" 4
By default OSX is not case sensitive. OSX drives can be
formatted to support case sensitivity. This tends
not to be a problem unles working with a model which was
created on Linux which might have Readme.txt and readme.txt
as separate files.
.IP "   Linux" 4
Linux is case sensitive.  A folder named Src is different 
from a folder named src which is different from a folder
named SRC.
.IP "\(bu " 2
The ESP-r executables and databases and example models
tend to be installed in standard locations for Cyginw
(/usr/esru), OSX (/opt/esru), Linux (/opt/esru or /usr/esru).
The layout of the ESP-r distribution is the same in each
so the navigation skills needed to investigate the
ESP-r distribution are common.
.SH
Examples
.LP
The following discussion will help you gain a basic understanding
and serve as a reference. Items in <> would be replaced by your 
own text. Items in () are comments.
.LP
Commands tend to be terse - "cp" for copy, "mv" for move 
etc. Each has a dozen options so that copies can be recursive, 
file listings can be brief, extensive, sorted by some key. Those
that remember the DOS command line will find the facilities
are much richer (but also sensitive to capital and lower
case).
.LP
It is possible to find out more about a specific command
by giving the commands in the following form:
.nf
  man <command name>
  
  man ls

NAME
     ls -- list directory contents

SYNOPSIS
     ls [-ABCFGHLOPRSTUW@abcdefghiklmnopqrstuwx1] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     For each operand that names a file of a type other than directory,
     ls displays its name as well as any requested, associated informa-
     tion.  For each operand that names a file of type directory, ls
     displays the names of files contained within that directory, as
     well as any requested, associated information.
  
  . . .
     The following options are available:

     -1      (The numeric digit ``one''.)  Force output to be one entry
             per line.  This is the default when output is not to a ter-
             minal.

     -A      List all entries except for . and ...  Always set for the
             super-user.
 . . .
.fi
.LP
So you can see that the command to list a directory has more than a
dozen options. Over time you will identify which options are useful
to you.
.SH
Moving around:
.LP
Given the following directories and files:
.nf

\fB /				(root)
 /home/jackson		(the home of jackson)
              /project_a	(folder for a project)
              /memos		(folder for memos)
                    /fax_121196_gary, fax_1106_mark, fax

              /email		(folder for emails)

 /usr/esru			(the home of esp-r) 
 /opt/esru			(alternative home of esp-r) 
          /esp-r
                /bin		(where esp-r executables live)
                    /bps, prj res	(esp-r modules)
                /training	(where training models live)
                         /simple
                                /cfg
                                    /bld_simple.cfg
\fR
.fi
.LP
When you log in you will be in your home folder.
If you get confused about where you happen to be
at any time then give the command
.nf

  \fBpwd\fR
.fi
.LP
(print working folder) which will return information like: /home/jackson/memos
.LP
To move around use the command "cd  <folder_name>" to 
go there. Ensure there is a space after the command and before
the argument used by the command.
To move to the set of folders used by esp-r use the command
.nf

  \fBcd /usr/esru/esp-r\fR
.fi
.LP
The <folder_name> can be relative -
in which case ".." means go up a level. To move
to the folder above give the command
.nf

  \fBcd ..\fR
.fi
.LP
The <folder_name> can also be absolute -
so to go into the folder of esp-r executables
(from your current location) to see how big they 
are you can use the command
.nf

  \fBcd /usr/esru/esp-r/bin\fR
.fi
.LP
If no folder_name is given then you are returned to
your home folder:
.nf

  \fBcd \fR
.fi
.LP
The use of absolute paths within an ESP-r model can cause
problems if you need to pass the model to a colleague. For
example, if your model references the database
.nf
   \fB /home/fred/databases/fred-materials.db\fR
.fi
.LP
and you send the model to a colleague who does not
have a \fB /home/fred \fR on their machine then
the model files would need to be edited to stipulate
an alternative location for fred-materials.db.
.SH
Copying files:
.LP
In your home folder structure, say you wanted
to copy a file (say fax_121109_gary) for use as the basis for a new fax.
.nf

  \fBcp fax_121109_gary fax_050210\fR

the syntax is cp  <soure>  <destination>
.fi
.LP
If, while in your home folder you want to
copy a model file in /usr/esru/esp-r/training/simple
to your home folder for printing or editing then
.nf

  \fBcp  /usr/esru/esp-r/training/simple/cfg/bld_simple.cfg  .\fR
.fi
.LP
in this case the "." is short for "where I am now". Because
no name was given in the destination the copied file
will have the same name as the source. If you wanted
to change the name as you copied it you use the command:
.nf

  \fBcp  /usr/esru/esp-r/training/simple/cfg/bld_simple.cfg  ralph.cfg\fR
.fi
.LP
You could also change the name by the command:
.nf

  \fBmv  bld_simple.cfg  ralph.cfg\fR

where the syntax is mv  <source>  <destination>
.fi
.SH
Viewing files:
.LP
To view the contents of a text file, one option is to use the command:
.nf

  \fBmore  bld_simple.cfg\fR

where the syntax is more  <file name>
.fi
.LP
If the displayed text does not fit within the display
then more will pause before displaying further pages
of text. 
.SH
Creating directories:
.LP
In the above folder structure, say you wanted
to begin a new project. There is already a folder
called project-a and if you want to create a project-b
at the same level give the following commands:
.nf

  \fBcd  /home/jackson
  mkdir  project-b\fR
.fi
.LP
you can then move into this new folder via the command:
.nf

  \fBcd  project-b\fR
.fi
.SH
Finding out what is in a folder:
.LP
The normal way to find out the contents of a folder 
is to use the "ls" command.  For example a listing
of the contents of "memos" is
.nf

ls  memos
Beattie                 home_off_cover2         roosvlt_280196
bepac_lmia              home_off_cover3         roosvlt_280196.ps
home_off_cover          pcs210394
lambda: jon/textfR 
.fi
.LP
Unless you know what these names represent you might want to
find out more. A long listing is:
.nf

ls -l memos
total 44
-rw-r--r--  1 jon          1990 May 24  2003 Beattie
-rw-r--r--  1 jon          1665 May 30  2005 bepac_lmia
-rw-r--r--  1 jon          3102 Mar 12  2003 home_off_cover
-rw-r--r--  1 jon          4078 Feb  5  2004 home_off_cover2
-rw-r--r--  1 jon          4163 Mar 27  2005 home_off_cover3
-rw-r--r--  1 jon          2133 Nov 30  2004 pcs210394
-rw-r--r--  1 jon          1678 Oct 28 14:04 roosvlt_280196
-rw-r--r--  1 jon         22035 Oct 28 14:05 roosvlt_280196.ps\fR
.fi
.LP
The "-rw-r--r--" represents the permissions and file types. In this
case the user has read & write permission and the "group" of the
user and "others" can read these files but they cannot modify
them. The "-" in the first column denotes a file. The owner
of the file comes next and then the size of the file, a date
stamp and then the name.
.LP
Lets say we want to prevent others from reading the contents
of the file home_off_cover2 but we want to allow people
in our group to write to the file we could do this via the
commands:
.nf

\fBchmod o-r home_off_cover2\fR
\fBchmod g+w home_off_cover2\fR

ls -l memos
total 44
-rw-r--r--  1 jon          1990 May 24  2003 Beattie
-rw-r--r--  1 jon          1665 May 30  2005 bepac_lmia
-rw-r--r--  1 jon          3102 Mar 12  2003 home_off_cover
-rw-rw----  1 jon          4078 Feb  5  2004 home_off_cover2
-rw-r--r--  1 jon          4163 Mar 27  2005 home_off_cover3
-rw-r--r--  1 jon          2133 Nov 30  2004 pcs210394
-rw-r--r--  1 jon          1678 Oct 28 14:04 roosvlt_280196
-rw-r--r--  1 jon         22035 Oct 28 14:05 roosvlt_280196.ps\fR

.fi
.LP
The above commands would work in OSX and Linux and Cygwin. If
someone else owned the files you would need to preface the
command with a 'sudo' in OSX and Linux.  In Cygwin you would
have to switch users to change the permissions.
.LP
A common problem with permissions is for so-called scripts
which can automate tasks. If you copy a script or get it
via an email transfer the execute permissions may get lost.
When this happens the script does not run. You might get
a message about permissions and you might get no response
at all.  To restore the permissions you would need to
give a command like:
.nf

  \fBchmod a+x myscript.sh\fR
.fi
.SH
Finding executables
.LP
Most operating systems include options for searching within a 
disk drive for specific files but that can take a long time 
to run. Sometimes it is useful to quickly find out where your computer
operating system thinks is the location of an executable (
such as one of the ESP-r executables). An IT support person
might ask you about this.  For Cygwin and OSX and Linux
there is the \fBwhich\fR command.  Lets look for the
ESP-r simulator via the command:
.nf

   \fBwhich bps
   /usr/esru/esp-r/bin/bps\fR
.fi
.LP
If you have used the link_to script to set a short-cut to
the ESP-r distribution you might get the following:
.nf

   \fBwhich bps
   /home/fred/bin/bps\fR
.fi
.LP
which is a link. In which case if you really want to locate the actual
simulator you would need to give a further command:
.nf

  \fBls -l /home/fred/bin/bps\fR
.fi
.LP
The \fBwhich\fR command makes use of the PATH information in
your account.  If there is a response to the command then that
indicates that the ESP-r module has been located in one of the
standard paths known to your account.  If there is \fBno\fR
response then it could indicated that your environment variables
have not been correctly setup.
.LP
If \fBwhich\fR did not work then on Cygwin and OSX and Linux 
you could try an alternative file search technique via the \fBfind\fR
command.  The general form of find is:
.nf

  \fBfind . -name <name_of_file> -print
  
  find . -name bps.exe -print
  
  find . -name "*.cfg" -print\fR
.fi
.LP
In the above the dot after the find command is equivalent to
my-current-location (and implicitly all of the sub-folders
within my-current-location).  The -print is required so that you can
see the result of the search.  The -name command indicates
that the next token in the command line will indicate the
name of the file.  Use double quotes if there are spaces in
the file name or if you are going to use a wild-card. Thus
the last command above will report on all files which end
in .cfg within all sub-folders of the current location.
.SH
Finding what is in files:
.LP
Often we are confronted by the need to locate a topic or
key word within a file. There is a command line tool
named 'grep' which is designed to do this.  As an example
if I wanted to quickly check the location of the word fred
in a text file the command response would be:
.nf

\fB grep -ni fred esp_command_line_hints.text
17:the 'Fred sent me a model and I can't get it working' variety.
153:path pattern /home/fred/databases and on OSX will follow
154:the pattern /Users/fred/databases.
171:folders (for a folder namde /home/fred/Src the commands:
173:cd /home/fred/src and cd /home/fred/Src are equivalent.
315:   /home/fred/databases/fred-materials.db
319:have a /home/fred on their machine then
321:an alternative location for fred-materials.db. \fR

.fi
.LP
The option -n requests the line number and the -i says
ignore the case (Fred = fred). Grep can be used to search
multiple files and folder structures.
.SH
Editing files
.LP
ESP-r models are largely composed of ASCII text files. We recommend
your first choice for manipulating ESP-r models is via the ESP-r
interface.  There are times when direct editing of files is
required so \fIif you must edit\fR then do so with tools which
are least likely to corrupt your model files.
.LP
Firstly, ESP-r model files may be sensitive to formatting
rules so if you use an editor that automatically warps text
lines then you may corrupt the file.  Second ESP-r model
files must maintain the so-called line ending characters
that they started out with.
.IP "Cygwin" 3
There are several editors which can run within Cygwin via one
of the graphic command windows - nedit and nano are examples
of text editors that can be installed within Cygwin.
.br
Cywin lives within the Windows file structure and you can
also invoke editors from Windows. Avoid Word or Notepad
for edit ESP-r model files. A great free editor is Notepad++
(easily found on the web).  WordPad can be used with care.
.IP "OSX" 3
If you used the Fink or MacPorts environments when you setup
your computer for ESP-r use then you can install one of the
standard Linux editors (nedit or medit) for use with ESP-r files.
The (not free) BBedit editor works well with ESP-r model files.
.IP "Linux" 3
There are dozens of text editors available on Linux. Almost
any of them can be used with ESP-r model files.
.LP
Settings within text editors:  a) turn off line warping, b) avoid tab
characters in ESP-r model files, c) generally stick with Unix line
endings on OSX, Linux and Cygwin.
.SH
Finding differences in files:
.LP
Many people assume that determining the differences between
text files (e.g. model files or reports) is a tedius
process.  We have many options beginning with a command
line tool called 'diff'.  If there are two model configration
files and I want to see the differences:
.nf

 diff bld_simple.cfg  bld_simple_fzy.cfg
3,5c3,5
< # bld_simple.cfg
< *date Fri Jul 23 16:07:40 2010  # latest file modification

.fi
.LP
Lines with < are the first file and > signals the second
file in the original command.  The tool diff and its
variants are available on all the platforms.
.IP "   OSX" 6
OSX offers a comparison tool as part of the XCode source code
development environment. It is used via:
.br
opendiff <file name> <file name>
.IP "   Linux" 6
Depending on whether you are using Gnome or KDE there will
be a slightly different choice of file differencing utilities
to choose from.  kompare shows a side-by-side graphic view
of file differences. It also is capable of copying specific
differences between files.
.LP
One of the most valuable uses for file differencing tools
is for looking at two different model contents reports!  
.SH
Removing files:
.LP
Sometimes you want to get rid of a file. Unlike other operating
systems, when you do this you REALLY delete it. The syntax is:
.nf

  \fBrm  <file_name>\fR
.fi
.LP
Remove has lots of powerful options which experts occassionally
use. The operating system also provides facilities for archiving
your work (see next discussion).
.SH
Making backups of files and/or directories:
.LP
Anyone who has lost half a weeks work by a disk crash or one 
of "rm's" more powerful options has an interest in archiving
their work. Linux and OSX and Cygwin provide a simple way to save your projects 
similar to how one might use zip to create archives on a PC. It is called
"tar". Tar creates an archive file out of the contents
of many files or folders and sub-folders.  Say
I wanted to archive the memos folder I would give the
following command:
.nf

\fBlambda: jon/text% tar  cvf  memos_030297.tar  memos
memos/
memos/pcs210394

This says create verbosely the file memos_030297.tar with
the contents of the folder memos. The resulting file:
.nf

\fB  ls -l memos_030297.tar
-rw-r--r--  1 jon         51200 Feb  4 19:16 memos_030297.tar\fR
.fi
.LP
To find out what it contains I give the command:
.nf

\fBlambda: jon/text% tar  tvf  memos_030297.tar

which says tell me (verbosely) the contents of memos_030297.tar.
.LP
Perhaps I managed to corrupt the file roosvlt_280196.ps. I can
recover it via the command:
.nf

\fB tar  xvf  memos_030297.tar  memos/roosvlt_280196.ps\fR
.fi
.LP
which say extract (verbosely) from the archive memos_030297.tar the
specific file memos/roosvlt_280196.ps.
.LP
This tar archive, being a single file is easy to send to others. A typical
use is to create a "tar" file of a project, have someone halfway around
the world pick it up and then expand the project to recreate exactly
the same structure of project that you have.
.SH
Compressing files:
.LP
Sometimes you have work or simulation results which you will not
be needing for a few days. You can compress files with the
command gzip:
.nf

  \fBgzip  <file_name>\fR
.fi
.LP
which adds a ".gz" to the end of the file and makes it 20-80%
smaller. To reverse the process use the command:
.nf

  \fBgzip  -d  <compressed_file_name>\fR
.fi
.LP
For example the "tar" file of the memos folder can be compressed:
.nf

\fBlambda: jon/text% gzip -9 memos_030297.tar
lambda: jon/text% ls -l memos_030297.tar.gz
-rw-r--r--  1 jon         21290 Feb  4 19:16 memos_030297.tar.gz\fR

the -9 directs gzip to take more time for greater compression.
.fi
.LP
On Cygwin you could also use a native Windows compression utility on
files which live within the C:\cygwin folder structure. Consider
using the 7z utility (it is free). OSX allows you to right-click 
with a compression option.
.LP
Creating archives and compressing them is useful in archiving
models.  Disks die, files get removed by accident and thus
model archives are part of good working procedures. What we
include in our archives is a policy decision.  For example,
simulation results files can take up many hundreds of megabytes 
even in a compressed form.  Some groups prefer to archive
results files and others prefer to archive the instructions
about how to recreate the result file.
.SH
Model transfer
.LP
The transfer of models within a team that is geographically
dispersed can be made simpler if the procedure is regularized
and models are designed for transport. Here are a few
suggestions:
.IP "a)" 3
Ensure that documentation and images associated with the
model are located in the doc and images folders of the
model.
.IP "b)" 3
Ensure that project specific databases are included in
the model dbs folder and include a readme file which
identifies the version of the standard databases that
are assumed to exist on the source and recipient computers.
.IP "c)" 3
Include model contents reports with the model so that
ther recipient can quickly scan the contents of the model
without needing to invoke ESP-r modules.
.LP
If you are using Cygwin or OSX or Linux the ESP-r project
manager includes a facility to 'archive current model'
which scans the model configuration file and creates
a tar file with the referenced model files. This is
particularly useful if a model folder structure includes
multiple model variants - only the referenced files
are included in the archive.
.LP
If the resulting archive file is not large then you might
choose to send it to others as-is.  If you compress it then
make sure that the person you are sending it to has the
necessary decompression software.
.LP
If someone sends you a model as a 'zip'file then it was
probably created on a Windows computer.  If you are running
Cygwin or Linux or OSX you can deal with this file on the
command line via the unzip command:
.nf

  \fBunzip <the_file_name>\fR
.fi
.SH
Finding library dependencies
.LP
Say you just updated your ESP-r distribution and you can edit details
of an ESP-r model file but the simulator does not start.  Most frustrating!
This might be because of a missing or corrupted library (dll) file.  You can
use a command line command to investigate this.
.LP
Essentially what is needed is to go to the folder where the ESP-r module
executable lives on your machine and then use some command line magic
to find out more about the executable. 
.IP "Cygwin" 3
ESP-r executables tend to live (within the Cygwin folder structure) in
/usr/esru/esp-r/bin so if you Cygwin includes the utility ldd.exe then
you can find out about dependencies via:
.br
.nf
  \fBcd /usr/esru/esp-r/bin
  ldd bps\fR
.fi
.IP "OSX" 3
ESP-r executables tend to live in /opt/esru and the utility that identifies
dependencies is named otool so you can find out about dependencies via:
.br
.nf
  \fBcd /opt/esru/esp-r/bin
  otool -L bps\fR
.fi
.IP "Linux" 3
ESP-r executables tend to live in either /usr/esru or /opt/esru and the
utility that identifies dependencies is named ldd so you can find out
about dependencies via:
.br
.nf
  \fBcd /opt/esru/esp-r/bin
  ldd bps\fR
.fi
