Summary of changes:
- Update and upgrade (with exceptions) the model files for the
  A42_fuel_cell_comp_tests. Set model root name to match the
  variant for clarity. Included more recent databases in the
  model cfg files. Model contents reports generated for each 
  of the variants. The newer files have fewer abreviations and 
  clearer documentation and should be easier to maintain.
- Noticed when doing upgrade that the re-scanned and re-written
  zone construction and tmc files were radically different and
  a number of items were not found. The model zone files were 
  not matched to the stated common materials and constructions (constr.db1.a
  and multicon.db1). A better match was found in ccht databases, however
  the ccht_wall and ccht_window values still differed and model variants 
  were created that give a close match to almost all of the constructions 
  except for the properties of ccht_window and the ceiling construction 
  for which are unknown in any current database.
  Backup versions of main_second.com and main_second.tmc roof.con 
  and garage.con were made to guard against likely overwrites. 
- It would appear that a number of the models in the additional
  tests folders have orphaned zone construction files which have
  no equivalent common database entries. Such models are at risk
  of corruption if zone files are touched.

Testing
- Visual differences of all changes were carried out.
- Opened each model before and after upgrade. Checked for
  warnings while generating model contents reports.
- Ran case_100.cfg with close match zone files and found
  that differences were ~1W for some items and at the 2nd
  or 3rd decimal place. Some GJ report were off a few GJ.
- Ran case_100.cfg on development_branch and upgraded
  version with identical out.summary files.
